      The class meets MWF from 10:00-10:55am in 105 Annenberg. Most days, I will be in my office
      at 219 Powell-Booth the hour before and the hour after the lecture, so feel free to stop
      by. The rest of the time, you can reach me via email at
      <em>aivazis</em><em>&#64;</em><em>caltech.edu</em>, or telephone at 626.395.3424.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dzhelil Rufat, an Applied Physics graduate student, will be helping out. Dzhelil's office
      is in 333 Annenberg, his telephone number is 626.395.3551, and his email
      is <em>drufat</em><em>&#64;</em><em>caltech.edu</em>. Dzhelil has set aside TR from
      3-4pm as office hours.
    </p>

    <p>
      If these time blocks are not convenient for you, feel free to send either one of us an
      email to look for alternatives

    <h4><a id="objectives">Objectives</a></h4>
    <p>
      This course is an introduction to concurrent algorithms and programming techniques with a
      focus on scientific applications. I will try to pay equal attention to the implications
      of concurrency on algorithms, numerical techniques and software engineering.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will try to make as few assumptions about your background as possible. I will present
      an overview of the basic ideas in algorithm design and analysis, discuss relevant data
      structures as the need arises, and walk through short introductions to all the numerical
      techniques we will be investigating. However, I am assuming that you are competent in
      some programming language, with a strong preference for C or C++, although I will try to
      accommodate FORTRAN programmers. You will need programming skills in order to complete
      some of the required course work. Also, some of the later material will require a
      superficial knowledge of <a href="http://www.python.org">python</a>, an interpreted
      language that is becoming a common fixture in high performance computing.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will be making extensive use of <a href="http://mcs.anl.gov/mpi">MPI</a>, the <em>de
      facto</em> standard environment for scientific computing, and the only widely available
      solution for writing parallel programs that scale to thousands of processors. We will
      cover both basic and advanced techniques, including some of the improvements from version
      2.0 of the standard. You should expect to be a comfortable, and perhaps sophisticated,
      MPI user by the end of the term.
    </p>

    <h4><a id="organization">Organization</a></h4>
    <p>
      There will be no official homework assignments this quarter. I will assign exercises
      throughout the quarter, which we be collected and graded but will not count  towards your
      course grade. Instead, your grade will be determined by two presentation you will be
      asked to give.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first presentation is based on your -- perhaps partial -- results from last
      quarter. I expect a 15 minute presentation on the motivation for your choice of project,
      the identification of the portion that was expected to benefit from concurrency, your
      parallelization strategy, and any performance and scaling results you were able to
      obtain. You should wrap up your presentation with your project plan for this quarter. You
      may choose to continue improving your project from last quarter, or start a new one.
    <p>

    <p>
      The second presentation will happen towards the end of the quarter. Its focus will be on
      your final project results, with a structure very similar to the first presentation.
    </p>

    <h4><a id="reading">Reading material</a></h4>
    <p>
      There is no specific textbook for this course. I will update regularly the
      <a href="references.html">list</a> of books and papers, both online and in print, that
      complement the material covered in the lectures.
