  \begin{itemize}
 % 
  \item one of the major strengths of python is the ease with which you can get access to code
    written in low level languages
    \begin{itemize}
    \item for leverage, or reuse
    \item for performance
    \end{itemize}
    the interpreter itself is written in \cc, so you can get access to code written in any
    language that is link compatible
%
  \item python provides
    \begin{itemize}
    \item a \cc\ library that grants you access to nearly every aspect of the interpreter
    \item a simple set of rules for constructing shared objects that can be imported, just like
      any other python module
    \end{itemize}
%
  \item typically, the solution to this problem has three layers
    \begin{itemize}
    \item the archive and headers of the library you want to expose to python
    \item the interface layer that translates data from python to \cc, which becomes the
      importable shared module
    \item a layer in pure python that provides an object oriented veneer to the library; in
      our case this layer will also double as the component specification
    \end{itemize}
%
  \item it is possible to collapse some of these, but it is not recommended
%
  \end{itemize}
