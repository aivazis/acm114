      <h4>Biographical sketch</h4>
      <p>
        Michael is currently Principal Computational Scientist at the Center for Advanced
        Computing Research (CACR) at the California Institute of Technology. His research is
        centered on the design and implementation of pyre, an architectural framework,
        integration platform and problem solving environment for scientific computations. Pyre
        provides the software backbone for a number of large scale research efforts that
        involve high performance computing, in collaboration with other Caltech faculty. He is
        a Co-PI and Chief Software Architect at the Caltech PSAAP Center, part of a five year
        program funded by the DOE to advance the state of the art in predictive
        computations. This program is the descendant of the Center for the Dynamic Response of
        Materials, where Michael served as Co-PI and Chief Software Architect for ten years, an
        ASC/ASAP center of excellence funded by DOE at roughly $4.5M/year with the aim of
        leveraging the largest computational facilities available to improve our modeling
        capabilities of materials under extreme loads. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Michael is also the Chief Architect at
        the Center for Computational Infrastructure in Geodynamics (CIG), an effort to
        consolidate the entire set of state of the art codes produced and used by
        geophysicists. The goal is to provide a uniform integration platform for all these
        codes and improve their quality by employing modern software engineering practices. The
        center is funded by the NSF at the level of $6.67M over five years and is currently in
        its fourth year of operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2007, the NSF awarded $12.8M over five years in order
        to build the next generation of software for the data analysis of neutron scattering
        experiments (DANSE). This effort is centered on the Spallation Neutron Source, a $1.4B
        facility under construction by the DOE at Oak Ridge.
      </p>
