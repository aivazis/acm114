      The class meets MWF from 3:00-3:55pm in 306 Firestone. Most days, I will be in my office
      at 219 Powell-Booth the hour before and the hour after the lecture, so feel free to stop
      by. The rest of the time, you can reach me via email at
      <em>aivazis</em><em>&#64;</em><em>caltech.edu</em>, or telephone at 626.394.1114.
    </p>

      Stephen Becker, an ACM graduate student, will be helping out. Stephen's office is in 333
      Annenberg, his telephone number is 626.395.3551, and his email
      is <em>srbecker</em><em>&#64;</em><em>acm.caltech.edu</em>.

    <h4><a id="objectives">Objectives</a></h4>
    <p>
      This course is an introduction to concurrent algorithms and programming techniques with a
      focus on scientific applications. I will try to pay equal attention to the implications
      of concurrency on algorithms, numerical techniques and software engineering.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will try to make as few assumptions about your background as possible. I will present
      an overview of the basic ideas in algorithm design and analysis, discuss relevant data
      structures as the need arises, and walk through short introductions to all the numerical
      techniques we will be investigating. However, I am assuming that you are competent in
      some programming language, with a strong preference for C or C++, although I will try to
      accommodate FORTRAN programmers. Some of the later material will require a superficial
      knowledge of <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>, an interpreted language that is
      becoming a common fixture in high performance computing.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will be making extensive use of <a href="http://mcs.anl.gov/mpi">MPI</a>, the <em>de
      facto</em> standard environment for scientific computing, and the only widely available
      solution for writing parallel programs that scale to thousands of processors. We will
      cover both basic and advanced techniques, including some of the improvements from version
      2.0 of the standard. You should expect to be a comfortable, and perhaps sophisticated,
      MPI user by the end of the term.

    <h4><a id="reading">Reading material</a></h4>
    <p>
      There is no specific textbook for this course. I will update regularly the
      <a href="references.html">list</a> of books and papers, both online and in print, that
      complement the material covered in the lectures.
