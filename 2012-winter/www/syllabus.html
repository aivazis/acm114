      The class meets MWF from 3:00-3:55pm in 105 Annenberg. Most days, I will be in my office
      at 219 Powell-Booth the hour before and the hour after the lecture, so feel free to stop
      by. The rest of the time, you can reach me via email at
      <em>aivazis</em><em>&#64;</em><em>caltech.edu</em>, or telephone at 626.395.3424.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, there is no teaching assistant assigned to this course.
    </p>

    <h4><a id="objectives">Objectives</a></h4>
    <p>
      This course is an introduction to concurrent algorithms and programming techniques with a
      focus on scientific applications. I will try to pay equal attention to the implications
      of concurrency on algorithms, numerical techniques and software engineering.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will try to make as few assumptions about your background as possible. I will present
      an overview of the basic ideas in algorithm design and analysis, discuss relevant data
      structures as the need arises, and walk through short introductions to all the numerical
      techniques we will be investigating. However, I am assuming that you are competent in
      some programming language, with a strong preference for C or C++, although I will try to
      accommodate FORTRAN programmers. You will need programming skills in order to complete
      some of the required course work. Also, some of the later material will require a
      superficial knowledge of <a href="http://www.python.org">python</a>, an interpreted
      language that is becoming a common fixture in high performance computing.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will be making extensive use of <a href="http://mcs.anl.gov/mpi">MPI</a>, the <em>de
      facto</em> standard environment for scientific computing, and the only widely available
      solution for writing parallel programs that scale to thousands of processors. We will
      cover both basic and advanced techniques, including some of the improvements from version
      2.0 of the standard. You should expect to be a comfortable, and perhaps sophisticated,
      MPI user by the end of the term.
    </p>

    <h4><a id="organization">Organization</a></h4>
    <p>
      There will be 5 homework assignments and a final project. If you are taking this course
      for a letter grade, the homework assignments constitute 50% of your grade; the remainder
      will be determined by your grade on the final project.
    </p>

    <p>
      Homework assignments will be <a href="assignments.html">posted online</a> no later than a
      week before they are due. Please turn in your assignments <em>electronically</em>. We
      will use <b>bzr</b>, the source control tool, as the submission mechanism; details will
      be provided
    <p>

    <p>
      You have to choose a final project and get approval for it no later than February 10. The
      final project is due on March 16. Missing either one of these deadlines will result in an
      incomplete grade, unless you get in touch with me and negotiate an extension.
    </p>

    <h4><a id="reading">Reading material</a></h4>
    <p>
      There is no specific textbook for this course. I will update regularly the
      <a href="references.html">list</a> of books and papers, both online and in print, that
      complement the material covered in the lectures.
